Most sites want the same few things:
Markdown, a sidebar, search, some control over layout, and a way to drop down when thatâ€™s not enough.

Intermark gives you exactly that. No plugins. No magic.

* Markdown or HTML, mixed freely
* TailwindCSS and DaisyUI prewired
* Search, themes, and sidebar editing built-in
* Go backend, ~4k LOC, no frameworks
